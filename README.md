### Tasks
* Implement the given UI on a level of detail you deem necessary. Feel free to pick your own UI framework and libraries, preferrably something that is widely used like Vue or React, etc.
* UI has to be performant - feel free pick your approach on loading the data like creating a light dummy API interface around it or something totally different.


### Bonus
* Host it somewhere - choice is yours.
